# Main-Projects
This repository contains all my bigger projects which I committed a lot of time, and effort to.
These are based on what I have learned from COMS 127, and the internet.

1)Weather App: This is a weather-app which utilizes API to get data, logic to get relevant data, allows the possibility to save this data to a file, and load them later in a new program 
               run-time. You can either get data for the weather right now or weather forecast for the next five days, and the user have options to choose the metric unit(C or F).

2)Candy Land: This program is a working model of the game Candy Land. The game runs on a lot of functions, and is a culmination of what I have learned in COMS 127.

3Fibonaaci: This program can calculate the fibonacci numbers, and also the precise golden ratio given sufficient numbers. The main highlight is that it can create the golden rectangles.

4)Task Manager: This program allows the user to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the program.
