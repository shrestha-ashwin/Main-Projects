# Main-Projects
This repository contains all my bigger projects which I committed a lot of time, and effort to.
These are based on what I have learned from COMS 127, and the internet.

1)Fibonaaci: This program can calculate the fibonacci numbers, and also the precise golden ratio given sufficient numbers. The main highlight is that it can create the golden rectangles.

2)Task Manager: This program allows the user to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the program.
